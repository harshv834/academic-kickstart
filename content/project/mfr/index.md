summary = "The MyFoodRepo project aims to produce accurate nutritional value estimates from images of food items. My work involved training the baseline Tortilla image classifier on a private dataset of food images, handling class imbalance in the data, setting up a coco-ui like segmentation interface on MTurk, and a webcrawler for obtaining further training data. Proposed methods to handle hierarchical classification performance. The code for this project is still private and will be open-sourced after its completion."
